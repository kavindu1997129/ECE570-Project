# ECE570-Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that is recommended to run on Google Colab, especially for easy access to Google Drive. All required libraries are standard or pre-installed in Google Colab, so no additional installations are necessary.

### Hardware Recommendation

For best performance, it is recommended to use a **T4 or higher GPU** Google Colab. This can be set by going to `Runtime > Change runtime type` and selecting **GPU** as the hardware accelerator.

### Running on Google Colab

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Upload the Jupyter Notebook from this repository.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to mount Google Drive and execute each cell.

Running on Google Colab is recommended to avoid compatibility issues and to make use of free GPU resources if needed.
